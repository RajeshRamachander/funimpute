```

## Technical Distribution Requirements

### Package Distribution
1. **PyPI** - Core package with dependencies
2. **Conda-forge** - Scientific Python ecosystem
3. **Docker Hub** - Containerized deployments
4. **GitHub Releases** - Source distributions

### API Distribution
1. **REST API** - Microservice deployment
2. **GraphQL** - Flexible enterprise queries
3. **gRPC** - High-performance integrations
4. **Webhooks** - Event-driven workflows

### Integration SDKs
1. **Python SDK** (primary)
2. **R Package** (statistical users)
3. **JavaScript/Node.js** (web applications)
4. **CLI Binary** (operations teams)

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Open Source Traction (Months 1-6)
- Release on PyPI with comprehensive docs
- Technical blog posts + conference talks
- Community building via GitHub/Discord
- Integration with popular notebooks (Kaggle, Google Colab)

### Phase 2: Enterprise Pilot (Months 4-12)
- Identify enterprise beta customers
- Build enterprise features based on feedback
- Establish pricing and support models
- Case studies and white papers

### Phase 3: Scale & Ecosystem (Year 2+)
- Cloud marketplace listings
- Partner integrations (Snowflake, Databricks)
- Advanced ML model marketplace
- Professional services offering

## Success Metrics

### Open Source
- PyPI downloads: >10k/month by Month 6
- GitHub stars: >1k by Month 12
- Community PRs: >50 by Month 12

### Enterprise
- Enterprise customers: 5-10 by Month 12
- ARR: $500k by Month 18
- Net retention rate: >110%

### Technical
- Analysis accuracy: >95% recommendation quality
- Performance: <1s per column analysis
- Reliability: 99.9% uptime SLA

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. Simple Tools (mean/median imputation)
- **Advantage**: Intelligent mechanism detection + business rules
- **Message**: "Stop guessing - get science-backed recommendations"

### vs. Complex Platforms (H2O, DataRobot)
- **Advantage**: Focused, lightweight, transparent
- **Message**: "Purpose-built for imputation analysis, not general AutoML"

### vs. Custom Solutions
- **Advantage**: Battle-tested, maintained, documented
- **Message**: "Focus on your domain logic, not infrastructure"

## Distribution Recommendation

**Start with PyPI + GitHub** for community building, then layer on enterprise features. The codebase is already enterprise-ready, so this could scale quickly with the right go-to-market approach.
